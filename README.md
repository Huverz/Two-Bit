Two-Bit!

This language is still in the developmental stages!  This means that things can change quickly.  Whenever changes happen, all old compilers will be left alone, but a new folder will be added with the new compiler.  If code from somewhere else isn't working, make sure you have the correct version of the compiler!

This language has three types of of variable.  The first one is pushed, which is automatically recieved by each commands as input.  If the command does nothing with pushed, it typically simply pushes what was pushed to it.  The second is Array, an array which can be accessed by index.  The third is Output, which is also an array accessed by index.  At the end of the program, if Output is empty, pushed will automatically be outputted, otherwise the contents of Output will be.  

Command List:

0-Seperates commands

1-Adds pushed to its argument.  Not providing any argument results in pushed being doubled

2-Subtracts its argument from pushed.  Not providing any argument results in 0 being pushed

3-Multiplies its argument and pushed.  Not providing any argument results in pushed being squared



11-Divides pushed by its argument.  Not providing any argument results in 1 being pushed

12-Replaces the index of Array equal to its argument with its second argument.  

13-Checks if pushed is prime, pushes 1 if it is, and 0 if it isn't

21-Checks if its two arguments, or pushed and its argument, are equal, returning 1 for true, and 0 for false

22-Checks if its two arguments, or pushed and its argument, are not equal, returning 1 for true, and 0 for false

23-Checks if its first argument is greater than its second argument, or pushed if there is no second argument, returning 1 for true, and 
0 for false

31-Checks if its first argument is less than its second argument, or pushed if there is no second argument, returning 1 for true, and 0 for false

More coming soon!
